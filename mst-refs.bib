The analysis extracted 15 factors, each was associated with a list of practices. These factors with the associated practices can be used as a guide for agile process improvement. Correlations between the extracted factors were calculated, and the significant correlation findings suggested that people who applied iterative and incremental development and quality assurance practices had a high success rate, that communication with the customer was not very popular as it had negative correlations with governance and iterative and incremental development. Also, people who applied governance practices also applied quality assurance practices. Interestingly success rate related negatively with traditional analysis methods such as Gantt chart and detailed requirements specification.},

Research shows that teams staffed with the right people are more likely to be effective and efficient. There is a paucity of study that examines the important traits of IS professionals in team contexts. The objective of this research is to identify and understand the important characteristics of good team members in software development projects. We applied an established psychological technique (Repertory Grid) to guide our interviews with 21 experienced IS professionals, who have had extensive experience in software development teams. The comprehensive list of important characteristics was analysed qualitatively using open coding method of grounded theory. Fifty-nine unique characteristics were identified and classified into eight categories. Among them, attitude/motivation, knowledge, interpersonal/communication skills, and working/ cognitive ability were perceived by research participants to be the most important categories. Our study provides a context-specific (i.e. software development team) evaluation of important characteristics of IS professionals. The results have significant implications for IS recruiting, IS training, IS staffing, and IS human resource management. Our study also supplements the research on management of IS development teams.},

Teaching agile software development can be illustrated by teaching with lecture-based classes. However, involving students in a real software environment is a trendy alternative which fosters their engagement. Software engineering graduates are not appropriately prepared for applying their skills in a real software project. Thus, we focus on teaching and integrating teamwork-oriented skills in a real software development environment based on Scrum. In this work, we present Virtual Scrum (VS), a virtual reality environment that assists students with the running of a software project following the Scrum framework. VS supports artifacts needed for carrying out Scrum meetings and media-based tools to achieve permanent communication among Scrum members. A survey of students, who used the tool in a Software Engineering (SE) course, showed that VS is helpful to exercise Scrum practices.},

	abstract = {Purpose - The challenge facing knowledge management (KM) professionals is how to leverage knowledge for improving organizational performance. From a management perspective, it is important to utilize KM systems for improving communication, and collaboration to enhance employee skills with a focus on improving productivity. From a leadership perspective, it is critical to ensure that KM investments result in promoting collaborative culture both at individual and organizational levels to encourage knowledge sharing for better decision making and innovation. Ultimately, the purpose of KM is to leverage knowledge in order to improve organizational performance internally and externally. This paper aims to address these challenges from leadership perspective. Design/methodology/approach - This research addressed the following questions: how does an organization manage knowledge resources to gain and sustain competitive advantage? What is the role of KM leadership in making effective use of KM? A literature review was used to understand the role of leadership and the relation between KM and organizational performance. Further, two research studies, which employed interpretive structural modeling (ISM) were used to answer these two questions. Findings - The study finds that selection of a competent leader is critical first step establishing an effective KM initiative as the leader plays an important role in obtaining top management and budgetary supports and in building technology infrastructure to accomplish KM goals. Further, KM leadership assumes greater importance during its initial implementation phase. Practical implications - Effective KM leadership is a prerequisite to implementing a KM initiative and organizations will experience better results if they choose a leader before a detailed plan for KM initiative is developed and implemented. Originality/value - This paper provides useful information on the effective KM leadership role.},

Hence, the objective of this study was to first gather the requirements for website UX testing. This is followed by developing an Open Source Software (OSS) called Ultimate Reliable and Native Usability System (URANUS) to support most of the techniques used for usability test. The final objective was to benchmark URANUS against existing tools. The methodologies employed during requirements gathering included literature review and interviews with target audience. This was followed by development of URANUS using the Rapid Application Development (RAD). Based on the LBUT and RUT comparisons URANUS turned out to score relative high in terms of benefits with low cost of ownership.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Low health literacy has been associated with poor health-related outcomes. The purposes are to report the development of a website for low-literate parents in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and the findings of heuristic evaluation and a usability testing of this website. Methods: To address low literacy of NICU parents, multimedia educational Website using visual aids (e.g., pictographs, photographs), voice-recorded text message in addition to a simplified text was developed. The text was created at the 5th grade readability level. The heuristic evaluation was conducted by three usability experts using 10 heuristics. End-users' performance was measured by counting the time spent completing tasks and number of errors, as well as recording users' perception of ease of use and usefulness (PEUU) in a sample of 10 NICU parents. Results: Three evaluators identified 82 violations across the 10 heuristics. All violations, however, received scores {\textless}2, indicating minor usability problems. Participants' time to complete task varies from 81.2 s (SD = 30.9) to 2.2 s (SD = 1.3). Participants rated the Website as easy to use and useful (PEUU mean = 4.52, SD = 0.53). Based on the participants' comments, appropriate modifications were made. Discussion and conclusions: Different types of visuals on the Website were well accepted by low-literate users and agreement of visuals with text improved understanding of the edu cational materials over that with text alone. The findings suggest that using concrete and realistic pictures and pictographs with clear captions would maximize the benefit of visu als. One emerging theme was "simplicity" in design (e.g., limited use of colors, one font type and size), content (e.g., avoid lengthy text), and technical features (e.g., limited use of pop-ups). The heuristic evaluation by usability experts and the usability test with actual users provided complementary expertise, which can give a richer assessment of a design for low literacy Website. These results facilitated design modification and implementation of solutions by categorizing and prioritizing the usability problems. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

	abstract = {The unquestionable relevance of the web in our society has led to an enormous growth of websites offering all kinds of services to users. In this context, while usability is crucial in the development of successful websites, many barely consider the recommendations of experts in order to build usable designs. Including the measurement of usability as part of the development process stands out among these recommendations. One of the most accepted methods for usability evaluation by experts is heuristic evaluation. There is abundant literature on this method. However, there is a lack of clear and specific guidelines to be used in the development and evaluation process. This is probably an important factor contributing to the aforementioned generalized deficiency in web usability. We miss an evaluation method based on heuristics whose measure is adapted to the type of evaluated website. In this paper we define Sirius, an evaluation framework based on heuristics to perform expert evaluations that takes into account different types of websites. We also provide a specific set of evaluation criteria, and a usability metric that quantifies the usability level achieved by a website depending on its type. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

The result of time estimation revealed that the efficiency of the high usability website was higher than the low usability website, the same as the results of the other measures. From the results of this experiment it was suggested that the time estimation could be an effective measurement for the efficiency relating to the cognitive workload which was a component of the usability.},
